# üß† LeetCode SQL Solutions ‚Äì by Salom√≥n Alvarez

Welcome! This repository contains my curated solutions to **LeetCode SQL Hard problems**. Each solution includes a clean SQL query (written primarily in **Microsoft SQL Server syntax**) and a short explanation of the approach taken.

This project serves as both a personal study log and a professional portfolio to demonstrate advanced SQL problem-solving, clean code practices, and thoughtful documentation.
